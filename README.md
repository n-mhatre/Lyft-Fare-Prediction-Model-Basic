## **Data Analysis**

### Data Exploration

The project begins with a thorough analysis of the dataset to understand its structure and contents. Key aspects explored include data volume, continuous and categorical features.

### Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing involves handling missing values, removing irrelevant columns, and encoding categorical variables using one-hot encoding. Continuous features are standardized using the StandardScaler.

## **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

EDA involves visualizing the data to uncover distributions and relationships between different attributes. Techniques like pair plots, histograms, and scatter plots are used for deeper insights.

## **Feature Engineering**

Outliers in the fare price are identified and managed by replacing them with the mean value. A correlation matrix is computed to understand relationships between features and the target variable.

## **Model Training and Evaluation**

### Linear Regression Models

Several linear regression models are trained using different techniques:

- Standard Linear Regression (Closed Form)
- Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) Regression
- Polynomial Regression

Models are evaluated using metrics such as R-squared, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) on training and validation sets.

### Regularization Techniques

- Ridge Regression
- Lasso Regression
- Elastic Net Regression

Regularization methods are applied to prevent overfitting and enhance model generalization. Various hyperparameter values are tested to assess their impact on performance.

### K-Fold Cross-Validation

K-Fold cross-validation is used to validate model performance across different data folds, ensuring robustness of the models.

## **Conclusion and Next Steps**

The project has successfully developed and evaluated fare price prediction models for Uber and Lyft. The Linear Regression model with Ridge regularization has shown promising accuracy and generalization. Future steps include:

1. **Feature Engineering**: Explore additional feature transformations or interactions for capturing complex data relationships.

2. **Advanced Algorithms**: Experiment with more sophisticated algorithms like Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, or Neural Networks.

3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Conduct thorough hyperparameter searches to optimize model performance.

4. **External Data Integration**: Incorporate external data sources such as traffic patterns or events to enhance prediction accuracy.

5. **Dynamic Pricing Model**: Develop a dynamic pricing model considering real-time demand and supply factors.

6. **User Interface**: Create a user-friendly interface for fare price predictions based on user input.

7. **Continuous Improvement**: Regularly update the model with new data to maintain accuracy and relevance.

These steps will further refine the fare price prediction model, offering valuable insights for optimizing pricing strategies in ride-hailing services.
